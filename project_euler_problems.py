#The goal of this program is to complete the challenges on the Project Euler website.
#All credit for the problems goes to the creators of Project Euler, these are just my solutions to the problems

#the way that I will be taking care of the problems is by using functions
#I will code each problem into a function so that way it is easy to call a problem and find it's solution
#they will generalized in order to tackle the challenge more wholistically.
